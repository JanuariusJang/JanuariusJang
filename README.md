### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A passionate programmer and having an interest in Statistics, I decided to deep dive into Data Science with the 6 months Le Wagon Data boot camp. I am looking for a role as a  Data Analyst/Machine Learning Engineer in a Data Science team. 

Some of the things keeping me busy:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving the accuracy of the EPL match day predictor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to visualise data better.
- ðŸ‘¯ Learning the skillsets of a better data engineer
